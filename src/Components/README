I havent deployed my application because i have already exhausted my free trial for deployment on various sites and nowadays it is 
very hard to find free deployment hosting application.
This application is basically a clone of https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_fgh3cjb-kZmdDw1vnpWGM9pBGFi_3wh/view and all the info is 
saved onto local storage of browser and can be retrieved from there.
If you want to check the info you can also check in application section in inspect. Also i have encryped the password So, it is not 
visible to the user directly.


Thank You for your time to analyse my application.
